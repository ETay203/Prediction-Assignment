# Prediction-Assignment
This repository contains my submission for the Prediction Assignment for the JHU Machine Learning Course.

The project used a weight lifting excercise dataset to build three different models in order to predict the manner (how well) in which they did the exercise. 

The repository contains the Rmarkdown and html files of my project report for peer-review giving the R code used to build the models.

A preview of the html can be viewed here <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ETay203/Prediction-Assignment/blob/master/Prediction_Assignment_report1.html>
